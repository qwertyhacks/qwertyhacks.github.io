X-inject0r — static injector console

Overview
- Small static page that loads a target URL in an iframe and provides a simple JS console UI.
- Important: Browsers block cross-origin access to iframe content. You can only run JS from this page against the iframe when the framed page is same-origin (e.g., local files you control).

Blooket preset
- The preset populates the Blooket play URL and provides a bookmarklet to prefill the game code on the real Blooket page.
- For cross-origin pages (like Blooket), use the generated bookmarklet: add it to your bookmarks bar, open the Blooket page, then click the bookmark to prefill the code. The bookmarklet will NOT auto-click Join.

Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (best served from a local static server).
2. Enter a URL and press Load.
3. If the framed page is same-origin, type JS in the command box and press Run (or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter).
4. For cross-origin sites, use the bookmarklet generated by the Blooket preset.

Running a local server (recommended)
- Python 3:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000/x-inject0r/

Security & limits
- This tool does not bypass browser security. Do not use it to attempt unauthorized access.
- I provide only a prefill/bookmarklet for Blooket; I do not automate clicking/joining for safety and compliance with site rules.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add more site presets.
- Add a tiny dev-mode proxy (requires a server) to attempt same-origin wrapping for testing local pages.
